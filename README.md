What Is It?
My first actual useful project that I've deployed. This web app takes the users Steam username and retrieves their list of owned games, randomly picks one, and displays the result. Good for when you just can't make a decision on what to play. Has some error handling to detect when the user's profile is private or when they put in a username that doesn't make sense.
